# Game Jam Finale #

A dynamically generated slide deck for game jam finales.
There is never enough time for game jammers to finish their
game, much less their gameplay video for the final presentation.
To ensure they can still be included in the finale, we use
dynamically generate our slides so they can still add
and edit their entry up until the last minute.
