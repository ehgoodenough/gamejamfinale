# Game Jam Finale #

[Here's an example from Global Game Jam 2021!](https://ehgoodenough.github.io/gamejamfinale/#/11/title)

![Slide from the Presentation](screenshot.png)

A dynamically generated slide deck for game jam finales. There is never enough time for game jammers to finish their game, much less their gameplay video for the final presentation. To ensure they can still be included in the finale, we use dynamically generate our slides so they can still add and edit their entry up until the last minute.

As an input, it takes a spreadsheet of jam entries. It outputs a brusk slide deck with slides for each jam entry. [Click here to read more about assembling your spreadsheet!](https://github.com/ehgoodenough/gamejamfinale/wiki/How-to-Use)
